# Advanced Digital Asset Routing (ADAR) on SORA

**Proposal Date**- 

July 22nd, 2022

**Proposal Overview**- 

[ADAR](https://adar.com/) (Advanced Digital Asset Routing) is requesting a grant of XSTUSD 150,000 from the SORA 
community to help the company bring its product to its first paying customers and in doing so bring new 
businesses into the SORA network. 

ADAR is an accounts payable solution built on the SORA network and allows businesses to seamlessly transmit 
digital assets to payees around the world, in multiple currencies, at a fraction of today’s prevailing 
transaction costs, without excessive paperwork and settlement times.

ADAR has;



* Single currency input, multiple currency output.
* Negligible transaction costs, instant settlement, tamper and counterfeit resistance.
* Built on the SORA Network; a network in the Polkadot ecosystem.
* Fully- compliant with local and international financial regulations, i.e. AML/CFT.

**Why ADAR, Why Now? **

ADAR is an Abed Group portfolio company. The Abed Group is a family office based in Barbados. One of its 
pillars, Abed Ventures, empowers entrepreneurs to ideate, incubate and accelerate innovative Regulatory 
Technology solutions that address the development and governance challenges in the Caribbean and beyond. They do 
this by bringing together government, regulators, international organisations, investors and entrepreneurs to 
ensure that the solutions that they build solve real world challenges. Abed Ventures comprises a dozen 
blockchain companies, a private equity fund and a charity working towards achieving its vision for a sustainable 
and integrated Caribbean.

Abed Ventures believes that a market downturn provides the best climate for starting new ventures like ADAR. 
Market downturns eliminate inefficient and rent-seeking market players, while allowing true value-creating 
companies to demonstrate their impact and potential. 

**Proposal Goals**- 

Launch ADAR on the SORA network and activate the first paying customers.

ADAR will help bring new businesses into the SORA network. ADAR’s research shows that businesses worldwide are 
struggling with high costs, slow processing, and excessive administration in making recurring payments. Up to 
35% of businesses cite high accounts payable costs as a major challenge, and 30% of middle-market businesses 
cite delays in payment processing as an impediment to business, leading to nearly 47% of suppliers receiving 
late payments (Deloitte). These businesses can all benefit from ADAR’s cost-efficient, fast, and easy-to-use 
payment solution. ADAR believes that they can bring 500 businesses into the Sora Network over the next 18 
months, and 15,000 over the next five years. If each business transmits  an average of USD 10,000 each month 
using ADAR, this would translate into USD 150M in monthly transactions running on the SORA Network.

Subsequently expand the scope of ADAR to dividend payouts, airdrops and other mass distribution of assets and 
other developments down the pipeline.

**Scope of Work**- With a community grant of XSTUSD 150,000 ADAR will be able to launch its MVP and activate its 
first paying customers. (_Refer to annex for further details_)

**Current Roadblocks and Barriers to Success**- This technology is still under development. The implementation 
of this proposal is subject to community approval.
